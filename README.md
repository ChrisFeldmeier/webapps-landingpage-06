## About
This application was generated using AI. Each version represents an iteration of the development process, with improvements and modifications based on user prompts.

### Latest Update
Version 12
You are mounting a new html component when a previous one has not first unmounted. It is an error to render more than one html component at a time and attributes and children of these components will likely fail in unpredictable ways. Please only render a single instance of <html> and if you need to mount a new one, ensure any previous ones have unmounted first.
